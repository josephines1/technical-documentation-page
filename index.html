          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
            For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
            elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
            clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
            server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
            database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
            server.

        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
            (WWW).

          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
          <li>
            Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one
            of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
          does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
          JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
          basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
          from LiveScript to JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
          JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
          common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
          dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
          individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
          special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
          objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

        <header>Hello World</header>
        <p>
          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        </p>
        <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }</code>
        <code>greetMe("World");</code>
        <p>
          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser!
        </p>

      <section id="Variable_Scope" class="main-section">
        <header>Variable Scope</header>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
          global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
          current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
          called a local variable, because it is available only within that
          function.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
          rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function
          (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
          following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or
          global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in
          this case is an if statement.
        </p>
        <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
        <p>
          This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
          ECMAScript 2015.
        </p>
        <code
          >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
          defined</code
        >

          You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
          syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
          identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
          can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
        </p>
        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
